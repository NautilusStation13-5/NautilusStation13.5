## Nautilus Station

Nautilus Station is a fork of Space Station 14, taking place on some derelict undersea ocean research base. It focuses maintaining a slowly dying seabase, both above and beneath the waves as the denizens try to pay off their corporate debt. Station staff will face dangers with the likes of pirates, deep-sea fauna, and the crushing depths of debt. Enjoy adventure, drama, and combat as you attempt to survive.

Nautilus Station is also open-source, so anyone is free to contribute to the project! If you have questions or need help, don't hesitate to ask on the GitHub.

I also absolutely don't mind if other forks wish to use our code for their own projects. After all, SS14 is all about collaboration! As long as it's not code ported over from another fork, of course. See attributions.

## Building

1. Clone this repo.
2. Run `RUN_THIS.py` to init submodules and download the engine.
