  # Silicon Rule 8 - Your HUD determines who is a citizen
  Unless a law redefines the definition of citizen, then anyone who the HUD indicates to you has a job, including regular citizens, is a citizen. You cannot do something that causes someone to not be considered a citizen, but you can allow someone else to do something that causes someone to not be a citizen.
